Zernike moments

Fourier descriptors

HOG/SIFT

contour signatures

area/perimeter/compactness


magnitude spectrum (shape of energy across frequencies) — rotation analogue → phase removal
spectral centroid (“brightness”)
band energy ratios
cepstral / MFCCs (hugely used in audio)

Autocorrelation descriptors
captures repetition and lag structure
naturally shift-invariant
robust to noise and local distortions

Wavelet features
multi-resolution (local + global)
robust to noise
good for non-stationary signals

Shape-based time-series descriptors
shapelets (discriminative subsequences)
SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation)
PAA (Piecewise Aggregate Approximation)
DTW features (Dynamic Time Warping distances to prototypes)

Model-based descriptors
AR/ARMA/ARIMA coefficients
Hidden Markov Models
simple regression slopes/segments
